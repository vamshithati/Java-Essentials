<summary>1.Java Installation & Environment Setup</summary>


### 📦 Java Development Kit (JDK) Overview

The **Java Development Kit (JDK)** is required to **develop, compile, and run Java applications**.

It includes:
- **Java Compiler (`javac`)** – converts source code into bytecode
- **Java Runtime (`java`)** – executes compiled bytecode
- **Core Java libraries** – standard APIs
- **Development tools** – debugging and monitoring utilities

Without the JDK, Java source code **cannot be compiled or executed**.



### ⚖️ OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK

**OpenJDK**
- Open-source and free
- Community-supported
- Widely used in development and production
- **Recommended choice**

**Oracle JDK**
- Commercial license
- Subscription required for long-term support
- Used mainly in enterprise environments

---

### 💻 Installation on Windows and macOS

**Windows**
1. Download the JDK `.exe` installer
2. Run the installer and follow setup instructions
3. Default installation directory:
```text
C:\Program Files\Java\
```
**MacOS**
1.Download the `.dmg` or `.pkg` installer
2.Follow installation steps
3.Installed under:
```text
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
```

### ⚙️ Environment Variables (JAVA_HOME & PATH)
Environment variables allow the operating system to locate Java tools globally.

`JAVA_HOME` → Path to the JDK installation directory

`PATH` → Enables running Java commands from any directory

Example (Linux/macOS)
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
### ✅ Installation Verification
Verify the Java installation using the following commands:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```
Expected output:
```text
openjdk version "17"
javac 17
```
### ⚠️ Common Setup Issues
java command not found → PATH is not configured correctly

Incorrect Java version → Multiple JDKs installed

Permission issues → Insufficient installation rights

<summary>2. First Java Program – Hello World</summary>
  
### 🧱 Java Program Structure 
A Java program is built using **classes and methods**. 
Every Java application must contain **at least one class**, and execution always begins from the main method. 
#### Basic structure of a Java program:
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### 🧩 class and main Method

**Class**

- A class is the basic building block of a Java program

- It acts as a blueprint for objects

- The class name must match the file name

**Example:**
```text
HelloWorld.java
```

**main** Method

- Entry point of every Java program

- Program execution starts from this method

- Required syntax:

```java 
public static void main(String[] args)
```

### 🔄 Compilation and Execution Flow

**1.Write the source code**

-Save the file as:
```text
HelloWorld.java
```

**2.Compile the program**

- Converts source code into bytecode
```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```

**3.Execute the program**

- Runs the compiled bytecode using JVM
```bash
java HelloWorld
```
### 🖥️ Console Output

The output is printed using:
```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

Output on the console:
```java
Hello, World!
```
### 📌 Key Points
- Java programs start execution from the ```main``` method

- File name and class name must be the same

- Compilation and execution are two separate steps

-```System.out.println()``` displays output on the console

<summary>3. Variables & Data Types</summary>

### 📦 Variables in Java

A **variable** is a container used to store data values.  
Each variable in Java must be declared with a **data type** before it can be used.

Example:
```java
int number = 10;
```
### 🔢 Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types store **simple values directly in memory**.

| Data Type | Size    | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `int`    | 4 bytes | `int a = 10;` |
| `float`  | 4 bytes | `float b = 5.5f;` |
| `double` | 8 bytes | `double d = 99.99;` |
| `char`   | 2 bytes | `char c = 'A';` |
| `boolean`| 1 bit   | `boolean flag = true;` |
| `byte`   | 1 byte  | `byte x = 100;` |
| `short`  | 2 bytes | `short s = 200;` |
| `long`   | 8 bytes | `long l = 100000L;` |

### 🧩 Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types store **references to objects** rather than actual values.

#### Examples include:
- `String`
- Arrays
- Classes
- Interfaces

#### Example:

```java
String name = "Java";
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
```
### ✍️ Variable Declaration and Initialization

#### Declaration

```java
int x;
```
#### Initialization
```java
x = 5;
```
#### Declaration + Initialization
```java
int y = 10;
```

### 🔁 Type Casting

Type casting is used to convert one data type into another.

#### Implicit Casting (Widening)
- Automatic conversion
- Smaller type → larger type

```java
int a = 10;
double b = a;
```
#### Explicit Casting (Narrowing)
- Manual conversion

- Larger type → smaller type

```java

double x = 10.5;
int y = (int) x;
```

### 📌 Key Points

- Variables must be declared before use
- Java is a **strongly typed language**
- Primitive types store values directly
- Non-primitive types store object references
- Casting allows type conversion between compatible data types
